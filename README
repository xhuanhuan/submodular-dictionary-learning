** This is an example code for the algorithm described in **********************

"Submodular Dictionary Learning for Sparse Coding", CVPR 2012.

********************************************************************************


1.Installation

(a) add the toolboxes'ksvdbox' and 'OMPbox' into the matlab path;

  addpath(genpath('./libs/OMPbox'));
  addpath(genpath('./libs/ksvdbox'));

These toolboxes are downloaded from http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html

* Please note that you might need to recompile these two toolboxes when you use Linux or
Mac OS. You can simply run these two files within matlab:
./libs/OMPbox/private/make.m
./libs/ksvdbox/private/make.m

(b) You might need recompile the mex file "mex_sers.cpp" from our source codes by running
 the file 'make.m'. The mex files for WIN64 and WIN32 have been included in the package.

2. Run the code

Just simply run Demo.m.

For this example, we train on randomly selected 30 samples per category and test on the rest.
The dictionary size 510 is used. We repeat the experiments 10 times and the final results
are reported as the average of each run. The average recognition accuracy is about 70%.


3. Our source codes in the folder "SERS" are based on the sources codes of the paper

M. Liu et al. Entropy Rate Superpixel Segmentation. CVPR 2011.
